# Stopwatch Application

The Stopwatch Application is a simple web-based timer that allows users to track elapsed time. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The stopwatch application provides the following functionalities:
- Start the stopwatch timer
- Pause the stopwatch timer
- Reset the stopwatch timer

## Approach

The Stopwatch Application uses JavaScript to track the elapsed time. Here's an overview of how it works:

1. The application initializes variables to store the time values: `seconds`, `minutes`, and `hours`.

2. The `stopwatch` function is responsible for incrementing the time values and updating the display. It is called every second using the `setInterval` function.

3. When the user clicks the "Start" button, the `start` function is invoked. It starts the timer by setting an interval to call the `stopwatch` function.

4. Clicking the "Pause" button triggers the `stop` function, which clears the interval and pauses the timer.

5. The "Reset" button calls the `reset` function, which clears the interval, resets the time variables to zero, updates the display with "00:00:00", and reloads the page.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stopwatch-app.git
2.Open the index.html file in your web browser.

3.Use the buttons to control the stopwatch:

    -Click the "Start" button to start the timer.
    -Click the "Pause" button to pause the timer.
    -Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer.
