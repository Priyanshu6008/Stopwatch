Project Name: Stopwatch

Description:
This project implements a simple stopwatch functionality using JavaScript. The stopwatch allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer displayed on the webpage.

Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in a web browser or your preferred code editor.
3. Run the HTML file in the browser to see the stopwatch in action.
4. Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
5. Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
6. Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.

Code Overview:
- The `stopwatch` function is responsible for updating the timer values (seconds, minutes, and hours) and displaying them on the webpage.
- The `start` function starts the timer by calling the `stopwatch` function at a regular interval using `setInterval`.
- The `stop` function stops the timer by clearing the interval set by `setInterval`.
- The `startStopbtn` event listener toggles between starting and stopping the timer based on the current status.
- The `resetBtn` event listener resets the timer values, updates the display to 00:00:00, and reloads the page to restart the stopwatch.
